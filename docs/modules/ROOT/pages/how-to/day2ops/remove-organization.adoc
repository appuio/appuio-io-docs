= Remove an organization

== Prerequisites

* All namespaces belonging to that organization, on every APPUiO Cloud zone, are removed.
* https://kb.vshn.ch/appuio-cloud/how-to/day2ops/connect-control-api.html[Connect to control api^]


== Check for organization namespaces

On every APPUiO Cloud zone:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get ns -o name -l appuio.io/organization=<ORG_NAME>
----

If any namespace is still present, contact the customer and make them delete it.
Alternatively, we can delete them but we need the agreement by the customer that it is OK.
Make them understand, that this will permanently delete all persistent volumes without a means to recover them.


== Remove organization

On the control api cluster:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete organization <ORG_NAME>
----

= Unit prefixes

== Problem

On a low-level we work with bytes.
Representing bytes to a human isn't practical, therefor a unit prefix has to be used to make it better understandable.

== Proposals

There are two well-known unit prefixes we could use:

. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix[binary prefixes]
. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix#List_of_SI_prefixes[SI prefixes]

== Decision

We use binary prefixes.

== Rationale

* In IT binary prefixes are representing the correct data.
* OpenShift uses binary prefixes by default in their Web console.

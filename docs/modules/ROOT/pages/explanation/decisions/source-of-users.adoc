= Source of Users

Problem::
The source of the Users (User base) has to be somewhere well-defined.

Relevant decisions::
* xref:appuio-cloud:ROOT:explanation/decisions/arbitrary-usernames.adoc[User name choice on sign-up]
* xref:appuio-cloud:ROOT:explanation/decisions/usernames.adoc[User object names in the OpenShift cluster]
* xref:appuio-cloud:ROOT:explanation/decisions/stable-usernames.adoc[User name stability]
* xref:appuio-cloud:ROOT:explanation/decisions/keycloak.adoc[Keycloak as IdP]

Alternatives::
* Store user base in xref:appuio-cloud:ROOT:explanation/decisions/keycloak.adoc[{idp}].

Decision::
The User base won't be in {idp}, it has to be in the resellers IdP, e.g. in VSHNs IdP.

Rationale::
The User base belongs to the reseller and not to APPUiO Cloud.
The {idp} only stores a copy of the User and enhances it with APPUiO Cloud specific annotations.

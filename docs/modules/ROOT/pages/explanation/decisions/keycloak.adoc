= Keycloak as IDP

Problem::
We need to store user (including passwords), team memberships and organizations.

//Relevant requirements::
//* tbd, links to requirement page(s)

Alternatives::
* LDAP via control.vshn.net.
  We can use the existing infrastructure to manage users and organizations.

* VSHN-owned Keycloak.
  There is id.vshn.net which we could integrate APPUiO Public 2.0 customers.

* APPUiO-owned Keycloak.
  Each APPUiO instance brings its own Keycloak.
  This still leaves doors open for federation scenarios or other social logins like GitHub or Google.

Decision::
APPUiO-owned Keycloak

Rationale::
Keycloak is a well-known Identity Provider that provides SSO.
To ease integrations between zones, each APPUiO instance brings its own managed Keycloak.
+
There are also plans to make {apub2} resellable, meaning that nothing should really depend on VSHN infrastructure.

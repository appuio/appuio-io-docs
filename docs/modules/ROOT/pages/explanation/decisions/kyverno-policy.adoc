= Kyverno as policy engine
:apub2: APPUiO Public 2.0

Problem::
Kubernetes RBAC rules are not suitable to validate certain properties of resources.
They can only allow or deny operations of the whole resource.
On {apub2} however, we require fine-grained control of certain properties, such as labels or annotations on Namespaces.

//Relevant requirements::
//* tbd, links to requirement page(s)

Alternatives::
* https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[OPA].
  Open Policy Agent is a policy engine written for cloud native environments.
  Policies are written in Rego, which is declarative query language suited for writing policies.

* https://kyverno.io/[Kyverno].
  Kyverno is a Kubernetes native policy engine that uses Kyverno-specific CRDs to configure policies.

Decision::
Kyverno

Rationale::
Kyverno doesn't require learning a declarative language compared to OPA.
Especially writing mutating policies is subjectively easier in Kyverno than with OPA/Rego.

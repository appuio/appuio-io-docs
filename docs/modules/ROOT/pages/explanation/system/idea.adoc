* An instance of Keycloak is responsible for authoritatively store data on:
** Organizations
** Teams
** Users

* Data owned by Keycloak will be replicated to each Zone.
  It makes the cluster more resilient against connectivity issues between Keycloak and the Zone.

* The policy engine https://kyverno.io/[Kyverno], installed on each Zone, is there to enforce policies that go beyond the capabilities of Kubernetes RBAC.
  In the cases where Kyverno is not suitable, custom admission/mutating https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/[webhooks] will be engineered.

* A controller instance on each Zone will further process the the local cache of entities coming from the Keycloak adapter.
  It will be used to configure Kyverno for instance.

* "APPUiO global" serves as control plane and is responsible for synchronizing mentioned entities to all APPUiO Zones.
  It will run on one of the selected Zones only.

// TODO: define better name for control plane

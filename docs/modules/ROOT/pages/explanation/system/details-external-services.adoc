= External Services

Simply put, certain components in {product} can be either _self contained_ or _dependent on a third party system_.
APPUiO Cloud is intended to be provided by resellers.
This influences how the architecture is abstracting components that aren't part of {product}.

{product} features a plugin-like architecture with defined APIs.
Plugins will implement such an API so that {product} is able to consume and use external services
Examples are an ERP system for invoicing or payment services.

Let us take invoicing as an example.
Invoicing most likely will be the need to integrate with an ERP system.
Is very unlikely that potential resellers use the same ERP.
And even if they do, their configuration and processes are probably not the same.
In consequence, we need an architecture where {product} is ERP-agnostic but allows easy integration.

In contrast, a payment service needs to be integrated for billing.

Questions / Ideas:

* Unclear atm how the units are actually billed / look like
* MiB might be an unreadable number, we convert it to GiB
* Invoice: aggregated view. Attached a detailed report (Pod level, PVC level)

Notes from discussion:

* Pricelist needs to be versioned
* Dashboard for end-user
* Multi-step process to combine all the data -> ETL (Extract Transform Load)
** Source data combined with business rules gives the result, business rules can change and be applied to the source data again
* Transaction-based, every minute is one

Input for data generation:

* Measurement
* CRM (Customer database)
* Pricelist

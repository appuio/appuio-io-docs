NOTE: This page is currently very VSHN specific and references the https://products.docs.vshn.ch/products/appuio/cloud/pricing.html[price model].

== Example Invoice

This is how an invoice for APPUiO Cloud would look like:

[cols="4,1,1,1,1,1", options="header", stripes="hover"]

Questions / Ideas:

* Unclear atm how the units are actually billed / look like
* Invoice: aggregated view. Attached a detailed report (Pod level, PVC level)

Notes from discussion:

* Pricelist needs to be versioned
* Dashboard for end-user
* Multi-step process to combine all the data -> ETL (Extract Transform Load)
** Source data combined with business rules gives the result, business rules can change and be applied to the source data again
* Transaction-based, every minute is one

Input for data generation:

* Measurement
* CRM (Customer database)
* Pricelist

TIP: This resource implements the xref:references/functional-requirements/portal.adoc#_feature_send_invitations["Send Invitations"] and xref:references/functional-requirements/portal.adoc#_feature_accept_invitations["Accept Invitations"] features.

== Object

A virtual resource is chosen to allow for RBAC filtering for list operations.
The `Invitation` is stored in a `Secret` resource in the backend.
It may contain sensitive information such as the invitation token.

----
<1> The unique identifier of the invitation.
The client should generate a UUID.
<2> Free-form text that can be used to add a note for the owner sending the invitation.
<3> The email address of the user to invitation.
<4> Billing entity RBAC is cluster-scoped with `resourceNames` set to the billing entity ID.
<5> Organization RBAC is a namespaced `RoleBinding`.
<6> The token that is used to accept the invitation.
Generated by the API server.
<7> The time until the invitation is valid.
Generated by the API server.

== Access Control

[TIP]
We use the same access control mechanism for `Invitation` as for xref:references/architecture/control-api-org.adoc#_access_control[`Organization` resources].

Invitations can only reference `RoleBinding` resources that the user has access to.
This is enforced by the API server and mitigates privilege escalation risks.

== Accepting an Invitation

Invitations can be accepted by any user in possession of the invitation token.

Invitations are accepted by sending a `REDEEM` request to the `Invitation` resource.

== Invitation Messages

The {controlapi} contains a Kubernetes controller that sends out invitation emails.

The controller reconciles `Invitation` resources and sends out emails for all resources that have the `EmailSent` condition set to `False`.
If an email can't be sent the `EmailSent` condition is set to `False` and the `Reason` is set to `SendFailed`.
The `Message` field contains the error message.

SMS and other notification methods could be considered in the future.

== Invitation Expiration

The {controlapi} contains a Kubernetes controller that removes expired invitations.

The controller reconciles `Invitation` resources and removes all resources that have the `Redeemed` condition set to `False` and the `validUntil` time has passed.

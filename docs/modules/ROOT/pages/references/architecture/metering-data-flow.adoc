= Data model and data flow for Billing

[abstract]
====
xref:appuio-cloud:ROOT:references/architecture/metering.adoc[Metering of resource usage] explains the data collection for billing relevant data works.
This page explains how that data gets transformed so that it can be ingested into a billing/ERP system.
====

The core of this part of the system has three responsibilites.
First it must fetch the required data from the input system.
Second that data must be enriched.
That enrichment involves looking up prices and discounts from price tables.
It also includes matching the identifiers from the source (Prometheus) with the identifiers from the targed system.
Third it must ingest that data into the target system.

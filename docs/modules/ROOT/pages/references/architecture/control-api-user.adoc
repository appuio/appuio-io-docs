== Access control

As this is a cluster-scoped resource, access control has to be defined in the cluster scope.
For each `User` object, a `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` is generated in the background, which grants edit rights to the subject (owner) which relates to the `User`.

----
<1> This depends on the API server configuration: +
    `oidc-username-claim=sub` and `oidc-username-prefix=appuio#`

By default, only the subject which is the owner of the `User` object gets edit rights.

== Field Mapping

At VSHN, every customer has an Odoo partner record of type `Customer` and a partner record of type `Roleaccount` for storing billing email addresses and the billing contact shown in the _c/o_ line of the invoice.
The two partner records are linked via the `parent_id` field of the `Roleaccount` partner record.

The `BillingEntity` resource is mapped to the `Roleaccount` (billing contact) partner record.

----
<1> The name of the `BillingEntity` is the **billing accounts** partner ID in the ERP.
It is prefixed with `be-` to keep the name RFC 1035 compliant.
This works with the assumption that the ERP provides a otherwise compliant name.
<2> The name of the company.
Also used as the display name.
<3> The general contact email address of the company.
<4> The accounting contact information.
Used when generating invoices.
<5> The name of the accounting contact person.
Used in the "c/o" line of the invoice.
<6> The email addresses of the accounting contact person.
Invoices are sent to these addresses.
<7> The language preference of the company.
Future use.

[NOTE]
Odoo has the terrible habit of returning `false` instead of `null` for unset fields.
We already implemented a workaround for this in https://github.com/vshn/appuio-odoo-adapter/blob/master/odoo/model/odoo_composite_id.go[appuio-odoo-adapter] which needs to get a generic version for string fields.

== Record Handling

There are two records in the ERP that are relevant for the `BillingEntity` resource.
They can't be updated in the same request, so the adapter has to handle the update process in two steps.

Creation should be able to handle a failure in the second step without polluting the ERP with orphaned records.

Odoo allows to add custom fields to partner records which can be used to mark records as created by the adapter or might allow to store a transaction ID/ resourceVersion from K8s.

=== Get Billing Entity

. Load the `Roleaccount` partner record by the name of the `BillingEntity` resource
. Load the `Customer` partner record by the `parent_id` of the `Roleaccount` partner record

=== Create Billing Entity

. Create Company Partner Record
.. Tag as coming from the `BillingEntity` resource
.. Tag as in creation process (category or custom field e.g. `x_transaction_id`)
. Remember the ID of the company partner record
. Create Roleaccount Partner Record
.. Link to the company partner record
.. Tag as coming from the `BillingEntity` resource
.. Remove the in creation process tag from the company partner record
. Return the `BillingEntity` resource with the ID of the Roleaccount partner record

=== Update Billing Entity

. Update the Roleaccount Partner Record
. Update the Company Partner Record

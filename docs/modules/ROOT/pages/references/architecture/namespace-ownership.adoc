= Namespace ownership

:apub: APPUiO Public 2.0

To ensure {apub} users can create namespaces for their organizations, a Kyverno policy which validates namespace creation requests is deployed in each {apub} zone.
With this policy in place, an {apub} user who is part of organization `purple-fox` can create namespaces in organization `purple-fox` by simply executing

```bash
kubectl create namespace -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: tall-grass
  labels:
    appuio.io/organization: purple-fox
EOF
```

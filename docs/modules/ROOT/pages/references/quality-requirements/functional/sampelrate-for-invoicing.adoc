= Minimal sample rate for invoicing

Source::
Invoicing adapter

Stimulus::
Calculate invoice

Environment::
{global}

Artifact::
Metric storage for invoicing

Response::
A time series of usage metrics

Response measure::
One sample per minute

Rationale::
The scrape interval of Prometheus is only an approximate number.
Depending on the system load, scrapes can be delayed.
This is important because the smallest unit of interest for invoicing is a Minute.
With a scrape interval of 60s, a scrape might happen 63s later than the previous one.
If that happens, we miss a sample.
Ideally a scrape interval smaller than 60s is used.
This should guarantee the one sample per minute.
Downsampling of two or more samples is done using the statistical mean.

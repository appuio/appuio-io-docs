= Sampling interval for invoicing

Source::
Invoicing adapter

Stimulus::
Calculate invoice

Environment::
{global}

Artifact::
Metric storage for invoicing

Response::
A time series of usage metrics

Response measure::
At least one sample per minute

Rationale::
The smallest resolution an invoicing adapter can expect is one sample per minute.
Ideally a scrape interval smaller than 60s is used.
This should guarantee the one sample per minute.
Downsampling of two or more samples is done using the statistical mean.

[TIP]
====
The scrape interval of Prometheus is only an approximate number.
Depending on the system load, scrapes can be delayed.
With a scrape interval of 60s, a scrape might happen 63s later than the previous one.
If that happens, we miss a sample.

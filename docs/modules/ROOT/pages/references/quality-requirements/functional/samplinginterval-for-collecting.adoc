= Sampling interval collecting metering data

Source::
Collector of metering data

Stimulus::
Ship metering data to central collection storage

Environment::
{zone}

Artifact::
Cluster monitoring

Response::
A time series of usage metrics

Response measure::
At least one sample per minute

Rationale::
Our billing model asked for a resolution of one minute.
Ideally a scrape interval smaller than 60s is used.
This should guarantee the one sample per minute.
Downsampling of two or more samples is done using the statistical aggregation like mean, min, max.

[NOTE]
====
The scrape interval of Prometheus is only an approximate number.
Depending on the system load, scrapes can be delayed.
With a scrape interval of 60s, a scrape might happen 63s later than the previous one.
If that happens, we miss a sample.

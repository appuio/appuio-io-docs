= Sampling interval in the intermediate metering storage

Source::
Adapter running reports on the metering data

Stimulus::
Runs a report

Environment::
{global}

Artifact::
Intermediate metering storage

Response::
One sample per hour

Rationale::
The fact table will initially be used for generate invoices.
Invoices are generated monthly and one value per month would be enough.
In future, the fact table will also be used for other use cases.
For example to run reports from the {ui}.
For such cases, a higher resolution is desirable.
One hour seems to be a good middle ground between resolution and data usage.

= Namespace validation resilience

Source::
Input validation system user

Stimulus::
Validate input values when creating Namespaces

Environment::
Any {zone}

Artifact::
Input validation system

Response::
Namespace validated

Response measure::
With only accessing internal Kubernetes API

Rationale::
This increases resilience to network failures and keeps a low response time when validating.
The validation process should not be dependant on components that are running outside of the {zone}.

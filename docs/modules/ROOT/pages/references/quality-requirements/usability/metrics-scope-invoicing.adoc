Source::
Invoicing adapter

Stimulus::

Environment::
{global}

Artifact::
Metric storage for invoicing

Response::
A time series of usage metrics

Response measure::
A time series is returned per pod.

Rationale::
Users manage their workload on the level of pods through Kubernetes Deployments and StatefulSets.
However, OpenShift 4 collects metrics on the level of containers within pods.
Summarizing the data at the pod level allows to present the data in a familiar way to the user.

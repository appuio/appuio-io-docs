= Namespaces are owned by organizations

Source::
Developer or CI/CD pipeline

Stimulus::
Creates a new namespace or project

Environment::
Any {zone}

Artifact::
`kubectl`, `oc`, or any other suitable Kubernetes client

Response::
Namespace created and belongs to one of the creator's organizations

Response measure::
The organization to which the namespace belongs is granted the `admin` Role in the new namespace

Rationale::
Namespace ownership must not be tied to individuals but to the organization.
We consider giving all organization members `admin` permissions in new namespaces to be a safe default.
In contrast to OpenShift's default for projects of only granting the creator `admin` permissions, our default prevents that team members are left unable to access a namespace if the namespace creator forgets to adjust the permissions.

= Creating namespaces with ServiceAccount tokens

Source::
CI/CD pipeline

Stimulus::
Creates new Kubernetes namespace while authenticated with a ServiceAccount token

Environment::
Any {zone}

Artifact::
`kubectl`, `oc` or any other suitable Kubernetes client

Response::
Namespace created

Response measure::
Namespace is associated with the same organization as the ServiceAccount's namespace

Rationale::
To enable a Kubernetes native experience.
Developers should be able to use ServiceAccount tokens to create namespaces in CI/CD pipelines as if they're on their own Kubernetes cluster.

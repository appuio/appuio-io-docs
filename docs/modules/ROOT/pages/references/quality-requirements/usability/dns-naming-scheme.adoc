Stimulus::
Accesses an {zone} via console URL

Environment::
Desired {zone}

Artifact::
browser, `curl`, `kubectl` or `oc`

Response::
Base address URL uniquely identifies {zone}

Response measure::
The URL must contain the following information:
* Cloud provider identifier
* Geographic region
* Index or identifier within the geographic region

Rationale::
To enable memorable and recognizable DNS names when working with multiple zones.

Cloud provider:::
The cloud provider identifier gives immediate indication about possible technologies and architecture relevant for the {zone}.

Geographic region:::
The location can be important for BCM concerns.

Index within region:::
There may be more than 1 {zone} per region per cloud provider.

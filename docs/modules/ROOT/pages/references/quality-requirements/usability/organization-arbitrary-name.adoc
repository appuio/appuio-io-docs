= Arbitrary organization name

Source::
Developer

Stimulus::
Creates new {product} organization with arbitrary name

Environment::
Portal

Artifact::
Browser

Response::
Organization created

Response measure::
Organization name is granted but with limitations:
+
* Organization name cannot be changed after creation
* A warning in the browser view will inform the developer about these limitations

Rationale::
To enable a user-friendly experience.
Developers should be able to choose their organization name on {product} freely.
Internal discussions revealed that generated IDs are best for long-term usage (for example, a company name change), but not user-friendly or memorable.

NOTE: The organization entity also features a display name (which is not the same) and is freely changeable at any time.

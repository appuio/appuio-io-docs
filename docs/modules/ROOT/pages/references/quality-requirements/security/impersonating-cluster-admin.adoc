= Impersonating cluster-admin within {zone}

Source::
{zone} administrator

Stimulus::
Impersonating as `cluster-admin` (built-in OpenShift role)

Environment::
Any {zone}

Artifact::
`kubectl` and `oc`

Response::
Operation requiring elevated privilege granted

Response measure::
Operation is granted with the `--as cluster-admin` CLI flag

Rationale::
In OpenShift, certain operations (for example installing Operators) require elevated privileges.
Pre-defined users or groups are given the `cluster-admin` role in order to maintain the {zone} or provide technical support for customers.

TIP: This is similar to `sudo` in Linux.

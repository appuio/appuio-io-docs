= Resource limit per Namespace

Source::
Developer

Stimulus::
Deploys new workload in a Namespace

Environment::
Any {zone}

Artifact::
kubectl

Response::
Workloads are denied if they exceed the resource limit.
Workloads are the following Kubernetes resources:
* Pods
* ConfigMaps
* Secrets
* PersistentVolumeClaims
* Services
* ImageStreams
* ImageStreamTags

Response measure::
The workload is denied if they exceed one of the following Kubernetes resources:
* CPU (all containers in all Pods)
** Requests: 1000m
** Limits: 1500m
* Memory (all containers in all Pods)
** Requests: 4Gi
** Limits: 4Gi
* Storage:
** Request: 50 GiB (total)
** PersistentVolumeClaims: 10
** Ephemeral Storage (EmptyDir, writeable container layers)
*** Requests: 250 MiB
*** Limits: 500 MiB
* ConfigMaps: 150
* Secrets: 150
* Services: 20
* Pods: 45
* ReplicationControllers: 100
** LoadBalancers: 0
** NodePorts: 0
* Images
** ImageStream Tags: 50 (per ImageStream)
** ImageStreams: 20

Rationale::
* The {zone} shall be protected from abusive resource usage.
* A quota prevents a developer (or a system account) from creating potentially billable workload (accidental or purposefully) that could lead to surprizes in the bill.
* Quotas slow down resource consumption on a cluster level and that gives time for cluster admins to do capacity planning, e.g. scale up a nearly-full {zone}.

= Namespace quota per Zone

Source::
Developer

Stimulus::
Creates new Namespace in a Zone for the same organization

Environment::
Any {zone}

Artifact::
kubectl

Response::
Namespace creation fails with error message

Response measure::
Maximum 10 Namespaces are allowed

Rationale::
* The {zone} shall be protected from abusive resource usage.
* Having a limit of the amount of Namespaces that can be created per organization per {zone} slows down resource consumption that allows better capacity planning.

= Portal API Data Freshness

Source::
Portal API client

Stimulus::
Portal API client reads data from Portal API

Environment::
{product} Portal API client

Artifact::
Portal API client and Portal API

Response::
Portal API returns the requested data

Response measure::
The read data is at most 10 minutes older than the original data in the backend system (source-of-truth)

Rationale::
The data in the API is not guaranteed to be up-to-date to the backend system because of its asynchronous nature.
For the data which is presented by the API it doesn't matter when the data lacks a bit behind.
This circumstance has to be communicated to the user of the API by documentation and a data freshness indicator.

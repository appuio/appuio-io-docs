= Foreign components as Adapters

Source::
{product} administrator

Stimulus::
Desire to integrate a third-party component

Environment::
{controlapi}

Artifact::
Third-party component

Response::
New third-party component works transparently with {controlapi}.

Response measure::
Third-party system behaves according to the API specification (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract[Design by contract principle] applied to components)

Rationale::
The {controlapi} should ensure replaceability for parts of functionalities so that the foreign component can be integrated.
For example an ERP responsible for invoices can be integrated or replaced so that the functionality of {product} is complete.

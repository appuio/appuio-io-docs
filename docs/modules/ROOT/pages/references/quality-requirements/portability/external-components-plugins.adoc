= External components as plugins

Source::
{product} administrator

Stimulus::
Desire to integrate a third-party component

Environment::
Portal API

Artifact::
Portal API, third-party component

Response::
New third-party component works transparently with the Portal API

Response measure::
Third-party system behaves according to the API specification (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract[Design by contract principle] applied to components)

Rationale::
The Portal API should provide replaceability so that the external system which the API works with can be exchanged, as long as the external system serves the same purpose.
For example an ERP as third-party component responsible for invoices can be exchanged with another implementation so that the Portal API stays the same and continues serving the clients without requiring changes.

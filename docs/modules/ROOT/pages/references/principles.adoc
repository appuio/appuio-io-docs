= Design prinziples

* A instance of Keycloak will be responsible for authoriatively store data on:
** Organizations
** Teams
** Users

* We will make use of Kyverno to enforce policies that go beyond the capabilities of RBAC.
  In the case Kyverno is not suitable, we will create a custom admission/modifying web hook for exactly that use case.

* In cases where data needs to be copied to other locations, we will only do so in one direction.
  

* Data owned by Keycloak will be cached on each Zone.
  This for once is requried for Kyverno to work.
  It also makes the cluster more resilient against network issues between Keycloak and the Zone.

* We will enforce quota and limits on Zone level.
  As it is our main goal is to protect the *cluster* from abuse.

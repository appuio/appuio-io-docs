= Design principles

* An instance of Keycloak is responsible for authoritatively store data on:
** Organizations
** Teams
** Users

* We make use of https://kyverno.io/[Kyverno] to enforce policies that go beyond the capabilities of RBAC.
  In the case Kyverno is not suitable, we will create a custom admission/mutating admission webhook for exactly that use case.

* In cases where data needs to be copied to other locations, we will only do so in one direction.
  
* Data owned by Keycloak will be cached on each Zone.
  This for once is required for Kyverno to work.
  It also makes the cluster more resilient against connectivity issues between Keycloak and the Zone.

* We will enforce quota and limits on Zone level.
  As it is our main goal to protect the zone (Cluster) from abuse.
